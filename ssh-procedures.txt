Git so you must use a personal access token or SSH key to push

To use a personal access token create a token on your GitHub account with repo scope then on your Mac enable the credential helper and push. Commands to run in terminal

git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
git push origin main

When prompted for password paste the personal access token instead of your account password
To use SSH create a key add the public key to your GitHub account and switch the remote to SSH. Commands to run in terminal

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
git push origin main

About the message upstream is gone you can set the upstream once authentication works with

git push --set-upstream origin main
or remove the stale upstream with
git branch --unset-upstream
If you still get errors clear saved credentials in Keychain Access or remove cached credentials with
git credential-osxkeychain erase

and then retry the push
