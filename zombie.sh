# dont run this, BUDDY. A fork bomb will crash your system.
# # A fork bomb is a type of denial-of-service attack against a computer system that makes use of the fork operation in Unix-like operating systems. The fork bomb works by creating a large number of processes very quickly, which can overwhelm the system's process table and lead to system instability or crashes.
